print('There once was a mother and daughter who loved to kayak.\nThey went on many adventures across the waters of a large lake close to their home.\nOn their longest kayak adventure ever a storm suddenly appeared.\nThey pulled into a private beach to hide from the hail.\nLater when they arrived in their kayaks at their campsite,\nthey discovered a racoon had eaten their food out of the bear-proof container.\nThey were hungry and wet.\nThey had fun because they were together, but decided not to kayak camp anymore.')
